# Development Plan

## Current Features

- API client for Rush Analytics with methods for creating tasks, fetching task status, and retrieving results.
- Support for listing languages, Google regions, and Yandex regions.

## Planned Features

### Documentation

- Add detailed examples for all API methods, ensuring clarity and usability.
- Include a "Getting Started" section to guide new users through installation and initial setup.
- Add a "Troubleshooting" section addressing common issues such as invalid API keys, rate limits, and network errors.
- Host the documentation online using GitHub Pages for easy access and visibility.

### Error Handling

- **Custom Exceptions**: Define specific exceptions for common API errors to improve error clarity and handling.
  - `InvalidAPIKeyError`: Raised when an invalid API key is detected.
  - `RateLimitExceededError`: Raised when the API rate limit is exceeded.

- **Retry Logic**: Implement retry mechanisms for transient errors to enhance reliability.
  - Retry on network issues or 5xx server errors.
  - Use exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming the server.

### Testing

- Expand test coverage to include edge cases and error scenarios.
- Test for compatibility with multiple Python versions (e.g., 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12).
- Use `coverage.py` to measure test coverage and ensure all critical paths are tested.
- Add a badge to the `README.md` to display the test coverage percentage.

### Asynchronous Support

- Add asynchronous versions of the API methods using `httpx` or `aiohttp` to support async workflows.

### Packaging and Distribution

- Ensure `pyproject.toml` includes all necessary metadata (e.g., `classifiers`, `urls`, `keywords`).
- Build a wheel distribution for the library.
- Test the package on Test PyPI before publishing to the official PyPI repository.

### Code Quality

- Use a linter like `flake8` or `pylint` to ensure consistent code style.
- Use `mypy` to verify that all type hints are correct and consistent.
- Use a formatter like `black` to ensure consistent code formatting.

### Versioning

- Follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) for all releases.
- Maintain a `CHANGELOG.md` file to document changes in each release.

### Community and Contribution

- Add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file to guide contributors on how to contribute to the project.
- Add a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` file to set expectations for community behavior.
- Add GitHub issue and pull request templates to streamline contributions.

### Performance Optimization

- Optimize API calls to minimize unnecessary requests.
- Add caching for frequently requested data (e.g., supported languages, regions).

### Security

- Provide guidance on securely managing API keys (e.g., using environment variables).
- Regularly update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities.

### Marketing and Awareness

- Add badges to the `README.md` for PyPI version, build status, test coverage, and license.
- Create an `examples/` folder with sample scripts demonstrating common use cases.
- Write a blog post or announcement to introduce the library to the community.

### Additional Features

- **CI/CD Setup**: Implement continuous integration and deployment pipelines using GitHub Actions.
  - Automate testing, linting, and deployment workflows.
  - Add status badges for CI/CD pipelines to the `README.md`.

- **Additional API Endpoints**: Extend support for new API endpoints.
  - Add methods for deleting tasks, updating tasks, and fetching task history.

- **Logging**: Integrate structured logging for better debugging and monitoring.
  - Use libraries like `loguru` or Python's built-in `logging` module.

## Timeline

1. **Short-Term Goals (1-2 Weeks)**:
   - Expand test coverage and ensure compatibility with multiple Python versions.
   - Add badges to the `README.md` for test coverage and build status.
   - Publish the library to Test PyPI for validation.

2. **Mid-Term Goals (1-2 Months)**:
   - Add asynchronous support using `httpx`.
   - Host the documentation online.
   - Publish the library to the official PyPI repository.

3. **Long-Term Goals (3+ Months)**:
   - Add support for additional API endpoints (e.g., deleting tasks, updating tasks).
   - Improve error handling and logging.
   - Build a community around the library by encouraging contributions and feedback.
